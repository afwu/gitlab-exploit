GitLab CVE-2023-7028


GitLab CVE-2023-7028
The vulnerability was caused by a bug in how GitLab handled email verification during password reset. An attacker could provide two email addresses during a password reset request, and the reset code would be sent to both addresses. This allowed the attacker to reset the password of any user, even if they didn't know the user's current password.
